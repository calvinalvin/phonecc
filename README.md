# phonecc
A tiny helper to split phone numbers into country codes and phone numbers

## Motivation
Dealing with phone numbers is a pain. And yet its something we deal with on a near daily basis.
We created this project to help all those unfortunate folk who have to deal with the tedium of 
getting country codes and playing with them in phone numbers. Its mostly a WIP but we are trying our
best to find time to regularly update and improve the module.
